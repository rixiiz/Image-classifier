# Image-classifier
An AI model that uses OpenAI can classifier uploaded images

## Features
- GUI to upload the picture
- Supports JPG and PNG
- Uses OpenAI model
- Outputs 3 possible predicted classes and confidence score for each

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `openai`, `numpy`, `streamlit`, `tensorflow`, `PIL`
- `.env` with OpenAI API key
- `uv` package

## Usage
- Install
- Create a `.env` file with your API key like this (`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`)
- Run `main.py`

## Key insights
- Existing AI models like OpenAI eliminates the need to train new machine learning models from zero
- Steps to create a new AI model using OpenAI are very similar and straightforward
